It is reccomended to complete the requirements in an order similar to the outline below:

| ORDER | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                              |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Set the state in App.jsx with the animal facts (from data.jsx file)                                                                                      |
| 2     | Pass the animal facts down from the App component to the FactsList component                                                                             |
| TIP   | Use chrome dev tools for React to check the values of state and props in each component as you work through this challenge...or console.log to check     |
| 3     | In FactsList.jsx, dynamically render the data                                                                                                            |
| 4     | Fill in the Fact component with the data that's been passed down through props.                                                                          |
| 5     | Create an event handler function called handleFavoriteClick in App.jsx which updates the state of favorite with the name of the animal that is favorited |
| 6     | Pass the handleFavoriteClick method down from the App component to the Fact component                                                                    |
| 7     | Connect handleFavoriteClick to an onClick event for the button in Fact.jsx.                                                                              |
